AI Chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n2. AI Job Application Agent(s)\n\nJoin the Discord channel for your chosen project. Discuss assignments and bring questions to Office Hours with AI mentors.\n\nWeek 2:\nAll: Continue AI video-based learning and refine your understanding of tools like LangChain, Hugging Face models, and OpenAI APIs.\n\nEngineers: Keep building your chosen AI project. By now, you should have cloned the GitHub repo and begun working on basic functionality (e.g., chatbot responses, job-tracking automation).\n\nDesigners: Participate in Pitch Day. Youâ€™ll hear AI-driven product ideas from PMs and start shaping high-fidelity mockups. Team formation will be done via a shared spreadsheet.\n\nWeek 3:\nEngineers: Share progress on your AI prototypes. Focus on model integration, API calls, and system reliability.\nDesigners: Conduct short user interviews to validate AI concepts and refine high-fidelity design mockups.\n\nWeek 4:\nAll: Pitch Day! AI product concepts and prototypes will be demonstrated. Use this opportunity to gather Voice of Customer feedback.\n\nEngineers: Fill out this Google form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMIdZwHGNcvJcF-e-jPW4bepNL_OnBmbB4w-s58HUNEW1kkg/viewform?usp=send_form\n\nProvide:\n- AI tech stack & experience (e.g., Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain)\n- Rank your top 3 product choices\n- Indicate interest in being a Lead AI Engineer\n\nWeeks 5-8:\nWork with your AI team to build a functional AI MVP. Lead Engineers should guide system design, repo structure, and deployment setup (e.g., Docker, cloud hosting).\n\nWeeks 9-10:\nTest AI models and pipelines. Designers should help ensure user interactions align with customer needs. Prepare for Demo Day with iterative testing and practice sessions.\n\nWeek 11:\nFinalize your AI MVP for Demo Day! This is your chance to showcase an end-to-end AI product on social platforms. Aim for polish, scalability, and innovation.\n\nNote: PMs will create the central GitHub repository. Lead Engineers are expected to help peers with GitHub, AI system design, and troubleshooting.\n\nWeek 1-3 Assignments:\nKick off your AI journey with project-based assignments.\n\nAvailable Projects:\n- Project 1: Discord AI RAG Bot\n- Project 2: AI Job Application Agent(s)\n\nEach intern must select one AI project. Join the respective Discord channel. To balance teams, some participants may be asked to switch projects.\n\nWeekly mentorship and Office Hours will support your AI development journey.\n\nWelcome aboard! With dedication, youâ€™ll gain hands-on experience building AI products over the next 11 weeks. ðŸš€",
